#  🤖SocialSense AI

A privacy-first emotion and response assistant for autistic users of all ages.


## 🧠 Inspiration

Autistic users often struggle with interpreting emotions and responding appropriately in social interactions. Most AI-based tools depend on the cloud, which raises privacy concerns and limits offline access.
socialSense AI was built to help users of all ages (kids, teens, and adults) understand emotional tone and practice conversations — all offline, private, and accessible.


## 💡 What it Does

* Detects emotion and intent from user messages.
* Generates friendly, age-appropriate responses.
* Provides real-time feedback and optional voice output.
* Offers three modes: Kid, Teen, and Adult for adaptive tone.

## ⚙️ How We Built It

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* AI Logic: Custom rule-based emotion detection (client-side)
* APIs (Future Scope):

  * Prompt API – emotion & intent detection
  * Writer API – generate empathetic replies
  * Rewriter API – tone adjustment
  * Summarizer API – conversation condensation
  * Proofreader API – optional grammar fixes

*(Currently runs fully client-side — no external API keys required.)*

## 🚧 Challenges

* Designing realistic, age-appropriate responses.
* Ensuring accessibility and simplicity for all users.
* Balancing emotion accuracy with offline performance.


## 🏆 Accomplishments

* A working, offline web app accessible to all age groups.
* Interactive voice feedback using the browser’s Speech API.
* Simple, open-source design — lightweight and fast.
  

## 📚 What We Learned

* How to design inclusive interfaces for neurodiverse users.
* Integrating local AI logic without external dependencies.
* Building clean, accessible web apps using minimal tech.

## 🔮 What’s Next

* Integrate on-device Gemini Nano APIs.
* Add more nuanced multimodal emotion detection (voice, text, image).
* Publish a mobile-friendly version with progress tracking.
